| [SIMA generalist AI agent for 3D virtual environments](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/) 🟢 | DeepMind has developed SIMA, a generalist AI agent designed to operate within 3D virtual environments, focusing on interpreting natural language and navigating complex problems rather than traditional game score maximization. SIMA has been trained across nine games from various genres and features a combination of pre-trained image recognition and memory-based models to process and act on both visual cues and linguistic instructions. | [Reinforcement learning 🎮](Topic_Reinforcement_learning.md), [AI for images 🖼️](Topic_AI_for_images.md), [Multimodal AI (image, video, audio) 📸](Topic_Multimodal_AI_(image_video_audio).md), [DeepMind 🧩](Topic_DeepMind.md) | 2024-03-18 |
| [RoboCat: A self-improving robotic agent](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/robocat-a-self-improving-robotic-agent) 🟢 | DeepMind’s new AI agent, RoboCat, can learn and generate new training data to improve its skills with different robotic arms, allowing it to operate new robotic arms within hours with just 100 demonstrations. It’s success rate on novel tasks more than doubled from its first version to the latest version, thanks to its expanding experience. | [Reinforcement learning 🎮](Topic_Reinforcement_learning.md), [Robotics 🤖](Topic_Robotics.md), [DeepMind 🧩](Topic_DeepMind.md) | 2023-06-26 |
| [AlphaDev discovers faster sorting algorithms](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms) 🟢 | AlphaDev, an AI system using reinforcement learning, has developed faster sorting algorithms for organizing data by starting from scratch and selecting computer assembly instructions using reinforcement learning. The new algorithms are up to 70% faster for shorter sequences and integrated into the LLVM libc++ standard library. | [Reinforcement learning 🎮](Topic_Reinforcement_learning.md), [AI for coding 👨‍💻](Topic_AI_for_coding.md) | 2023-06-12 |
