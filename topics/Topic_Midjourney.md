| [Midjourney debuts feature for generating consistent characters across multiple gen AI images](https://venturebeat.com/ai/midjourney-debuts-feature-for-generating-consistent-characters-across-multiple-gen-ai-images/) 🟢 | Midjourney has introduced an update enabling AI-generated character consistency in artwork through new tagging features. The “ — cref” tag allows users to reference a character image URL to maintain the character’s appearance across different scenes, while the “ — cw” tag adjusts the level of character consistency. This facilitates continuity in visual storytelling within the AI art community, although the precision of replication can vary. | [AI for images 🖼️](topics/Topic_AI_for_images_🖼️.md), [Multimodal AI (image, video, audio) 📸](topics/Topic_Multimodal_AI_(image_video_audio)_📸.md), [Midjourney 🛤️](topics/Topic_Midjourney_🛤️.md) | 2024-03-18 |
