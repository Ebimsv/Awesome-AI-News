The “ — cref” tag allows users to reference a character image URL to maintain the character’s appearance across different scenes, while the “ — cw” tag adjusts the level of character consistency. This facilitates continuity in visual storytelling within the AI art community, although the precision of replication can vary. | [AI for images 🖼️](Topic_AI_for_images.md), [Multimodal AI (image, video, audio) 📸](Topic_Multimodal_AI_(image_video_audio).md), [Midjourney 🛤️](Topic_Midjourney.md) | 2024-03-18 |
